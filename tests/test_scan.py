"""Pins for the codepoint scan scope stated in SETUP-3 as amended
by FIX-PG-6.

The scan is run as a subprocess against a planted tree, because the
rule is about which files on disk the scan opens, and only a real run
against a real tree can pin that. Each planted tree carries the scan
script itself under scripts, which is where the scan looks for its
own root.
