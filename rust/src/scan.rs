//! The scan counts the em dash U+2014 and the en dash U+2013 in
//! the files of a tree, under the scope SETUP-3 states as amended
//! by FIX-PG-6 and PORT-9. A file stands in scope when its suffix
//! is one of the listed suffixes or it carries no suffix at all,
//! and a file standing under an ignored directory stands out of
//! scope whatever its suffix. The reading mirrors the Python scan
//! script this module replaces under PORT-10, so a tree reads the
//! same counts under the library as it read under the script.
